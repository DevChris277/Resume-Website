            <h1>Automated the capturing of purchase orders from an email attachment into SAP.</h1>

            <p>As the sole developer for the finance division of Clicks, I was responsible for streamlining their process for capturing vendor purchase orders that were previously received as manual email attachments. This process was prone to errors and inefficiencies due to the manual validation checks and matching of orders with internal records.</p>
            
            <p>To resolve these issues, I developed a solution with the following key features:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Automated extraction of data from email attachments</li>
              <li>Cleaning, organizing, and categorizing of relevant information</li>
              <li>Validation of data to ensure accuracy</li>
              <li>Integration with SAP UI to upload the data directly and accurately into the system</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My key contributions to the project include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Serving as the sole developer on the project</li>
              <li>Designing the solution architecture to meet the client's needs</li>
              <li>Direct consultation with the client to manage their expectations</li>
              <li>Successful deployment of the solution across all production environments</li>
              <li>Identifying and securing additional sales opportunities for future projects.</li>
            </ul>
